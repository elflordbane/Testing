# Testing

It is important to study the specifications given for the program you are going to write.  In this case the contact had specific requirements that it had to meet.  Part of the requirements made the program more secure as well.   This was the functionality where the contact ID could not be duplicated.   This made each entry have a unique key to identify it.  The approach I took was to use a vector in the service section because that data structure allows you to add items to it with out having to specify a size and it has a built in function to return the vector location of an item you are looking for.  Those functions are useful for completing the tasks the service requires.  

The user needs are taken into account, and functions are built to accommodate their needs.  One example of this is the modify function which pulls up a contact from the vector by passing the ID to the search function which returns the location in vector of the object to modify.  Then the object is copied into a temporary object where modifications are made to it.  Then the temporary object is uploaded back into the vector and overwrites the object of the vector location it was pulled from.
